# Log Monitor Prototype

Building prototype for a log monitor using RabbitMQ and NodeJS. Would
be nice to have this in Clojure and ZeroMQ...

Usage

    mqtail /path/to/file.log

Then

    mqmon

Serve up the assets directory (will add this to the server some time)

Add more watchers, add more monitors, add more clients... Have fun
